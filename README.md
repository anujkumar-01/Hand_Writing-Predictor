# Hand_Writing-Predictor

The model will first get some data set which will have writing samples loaded, then with the writing flow, will check the changes in writing style. With all these data it will predict the writing style and match it with the test data set. This will reduce the loss function and further the model can predict the writing style and compare it with the input, to predict the original possession of the writing sample.


## First Phase of Work
The first phase of work will be to collect datasets and design a basic ML model. Also the important points inconsideration has to be implemented as labels for checking in test case. The DNN has to be designed with multiple layers and need to be checked for different values of epochs. The loss function has to be calculated by initial test case.

## Second Phase of Work:
The second phase of work will include the amendment in the model like minimisation of loss function and learning of model. Then the model will be further tested. The resultant model will be then given a GUI for interaction.
